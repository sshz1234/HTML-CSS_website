        <h2>What is it about</h2>
        <p>
          Magnetic levitation, often referred to as maglev, is a technology that uses magnetic fields to levitate an object and keep it suspended without any physical contact with a surface. This technology is commonly used in transportation systems, such as maglev trains, but it also has various other applications.
          
          In maglev transportation systems, powerful magnets are used to create both lift and propulsion. These systems typically involve two sets of magnets: one set on the vehicle (usually a train) and another set on the guideway (the track). The magnets on the vehicle repel those on the guideway, causing the vehicle to levitate above the track, with no friction between the vehicle and the guideway. Additional magnets are used to propel the vehicle forward.
          
          The absence of physical contact and friction allows maglev trains to achieve high speeds and provide a smooth ride, making them attractive for high-speed transportation projects. Maglev technology offers the potential for faster travel times, reduced energy consumption, and minimal maintenance compared to traditional rail systems.
          
          Apart from transportation, magnetic levitation finds applications in various other fields such as scientific research, industrial processes, and even in certain consumer products like magnetic levitation display systems for showcasing objects without physical support.</p>

          <h4><u>It's History</u></h4>
         
          <p>Although the phenomenon itself is now understood to be physically impossible, as was first recognized by Samuel Earnshaw in 1842, stories of magnetic levitation have persisted to modern times, one prominent example being the legend of the suspended monument in the Konark Sun Temple in Eastern India.</p>

        <div>
          <h4><u>It's Timeline</u></h4>
         
          <p>Legends of magnetic levitation were common in ancient and medieval times, and their spread from the Roman world to the Middle East and later to India has been documented by the classical scholar Dunstan Lowe.[35][36] The earliest known source is Pliny the Elder (first century AD), who described architectural plans for an iron statue that was to be suspended by lodestone from the vault of a temple in Alexandria. Many subsequent reports described levitating statues, relics or other objects of symbolic importance, and versions of the legend have appeared in diverse religious traditions, including Christianity, Islam, Buddhism, and Hinduism. In some cases they were interpreted as divine miracles, while in others they were described as natural phenomena falsely purported to be miraculous; one example of the latter comes from St Augustine, who refers to a magnetically suspended statue in his book The City of God (c. 410 AD). Another common feature of these legends, according to Lowe, is an explanation of the object's disappearance, often involving its destruction by non-believers in acts of impiety.</p>

          <h4><u>Notable Events</u></h4>
        
          <p>The highest-recorded maglev speed is 603 kilometres per hour (375 mph), achieved in Japan by JR Central's L0 superconducting maglev on 21 April 2015,[105] 28 kilometres per hour (17 mph) faster than the conventional TGV wheel-rail speed record. However, the operational and performance differences between these two very different technologies is far greater. The TGV record was achieved accelerating down a 72.4 kilometres (45 mi) slight decline, requiring 13 minutes. It then took another 77.25 kilometres (48 mi) for the TGV to stop, requiring a total distance of 149.65 kilometres (93 mi) for the test.[106] The L0 record, however, was achieved on the 42.8 kilometres (26.6 mi) Yamanashi test track – less than 1/3 the distance.[107] No maglev or wheel-rail commercial operation has actually been attempted at speeds over 500 kilometres per hour (310 mph).Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit.
